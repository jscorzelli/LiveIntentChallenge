Automation challenge for LiveIntent

# The Test
The task at hand was to create an automated test, which verifies a piece of funtionality on the LiveIntent company website.
Here are the steps the automated test executes:
1) Naviage to the LiveIntent company website (https://liveintent.com/).
2) Verify the existence of a button that says 'Get Started'. As long as this button is present on the website, this step      passes.
3) Click on the 'Get Started' button. The expecation is that the user will be navigated to a different portion of the company website.
4) Verify the URL after clicking on the 'Get Started' button. The expectation is the URL will be https://liveintent.com/free-evaluation/.
5) Verify the existance of a button that says 'Contact Us'. As long as this button is present on the website, this step passes.
